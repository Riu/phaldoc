App create to translate Phalcon docs 

About
-----

App is created in Phalcon 1.2 for translate and control changes in Phalcon documentation. It's also good tool to create documentation for others projects, if they use Sphinx  (documentation builder). It also use Twitter Bootstrap.

Install
-------

You need:

* download app with submodule __docs__ (this folder need chmod 0777)
* set your configuration in __app/config/config.php__
* set tables to your database from __dump/phaldoc.sql__
* run app and import data to database with instruction from app

Comment
-------

At present app is ready and works fine, but in future I would like:

* improve the security of data entry
* add parts views with chosen status
* add language versions to app
* prehaps good idea will by markdown editor
* improve mangament of config files and folder to subdocuments
